# The_BlueBerry_Project
Personal Finances Manager. Based on the spreadsheet BlueBudget.

*University Project to be continued...

This project started in 2011 with an Excel Spreadsheet I saw on the New York Times.
The Pear Budget was a simple Personal Finances Manager (https://pearbudget.com).
From there I upgraded the spreadsheet over the years to the BlueBudget.

In 2019 during the Computer Engineering Course at Universidade de Aveiro, I had
the oportunity to develop the idea in the classes of Databases and Human-Computer
Interaction.
This was a great opportunity to explore what worked and what didn't.

Database: (and Windows Forms App)
The database has extra modules compared to the spreadsheet per project requirements.
Most of them are misplaced in the app and served academic purposes only.

Android App:
The focus was on simplicity and usability. The app is the result o research, paper
prototypes, heuristic evaluations and usability tests.
